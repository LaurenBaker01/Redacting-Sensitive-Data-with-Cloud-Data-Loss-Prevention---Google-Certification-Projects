# Redacting Sensitive Data with Cloud Data Loss Prevention
Google-Certification-Projects
Project Overview:

I recently completed a project focused on Cloud Data Loss Prevention (Cloud DLP), a comprehensive managed service engineered to aid in the identification, classification, and safeguarding of sensitive information. Through the utilization of the DLP API, I explored various methods of data classification, including categorization by data type, sensitivity level, and specific information categories.

The DLP API empowers users with a range of protective measures, such as redaction, masking, tokenization, and encryption, each tailored to mitigate the risk of data exposure or compromise. In this project, I delved into the fundamental capabilities of the Cloud DLP API and experimented with different approaches to shield sensitive data from potential threats.

Key Learning Objectives:

Throughout the duration of the project, I focused on achieving the following learning objectives:

Inspecting strings and files for matching information types.
Understanding de-identification techniques and implementing data de-identification processes.
Redacting information types in strings and images to ensure confidentiality and privacy.
Project Setup and Requirements:

Before commencing the project tasks, I ensured that I had access to a standard internet browser, preferably Chrome, and followed the provided instructions meticulously. It was imperative to use an Incognito or private browsing window to prevent any conflicts between personal and lab accounts, thereby avoiding unnecessary charges.

The project required access to a temporary Google Cloud environment, which was facilitated by clicking the "Start Lab" button. Upon initiation, temporary credentials were provided for accessing Google Cloud resources throughout the lab duration.

Project Tasks Overview:

Task 1: Clone the repository and enable APIs

Downloaded the Cloud Data Loss Prevention Node.js Client repository.
Installed required Node.js packages.
Enabled necessary APIs, including Cloud Data Loss Prevention API and Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API.
Task 2: Inspect strings and files

Utilized provided scripts to inspect strings and files for sensitive information types.
Reviewed findings and adjusted configurations as needed for effective detection.
Task 3: De-identification

Explored de-identification techniques using the Cloud DLP API.
Implemented de-identification with masking to obscure sensitive information while preserving data integrity.
Task 4: Redact strings and images

Employed redaction methods to conceal sensitive data in strings and images.
Generated redacted outputs to ensure the protection of sensitive information.
Conclusion:

The Cloud Data Loss Prevention project provided valuable insights into the capabilities of the Cloud DLP API and equipped me with practical knowledge in identifying, classifying, and safeguarding sensitive information. By completing the project tasks, I gained proficiency in utilizing various protective measures to mitigate the risk of data loss or unauthorized access, thereby contributing to enhanced data security practices.
